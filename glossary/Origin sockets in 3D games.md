In the context of **3D game development**, when you see something like **"origin socket A, B, and C"**, it usually means:

- **Origin** → a **reference point** in 3D space (often `(0, 0, 0)` in the object's local coordinate system) that defines where something is positioned or attached.
- **Socket** → a **named attachment point** defined on a model, skeleton, or mesh — typically used for attaching other meshes, weapons, effects, or gameplay objects.
- **A, B, C** → simply **different named sockets**, each with its own transform (position, rotation, scale) relative to the model's origin.

### How this works in practice

In a 3D engine like **Unreal Engine** or **Unity**:

1. **Sockets** are predefined points on a mesh or skeleton.
   - For a character skeleton, you might have sockets like `"hand_r"`, `"weapon_tip"`, `"origin_a"`, `"origin_b"`, etc.
   - Each socket stores a transform **relative to the bone or mesh it belongs to**.

2. **Origin socket** is sometimes a special "root" attachment point:
   - **Origin A** might be a socket at `(0,0,0)` in local space for version A of an object.
   - **Origin B** might be a socket used for an alternate mode, skin, or animation alignment.
   - **Origin C** might be for another alignment or pivot.

3. **Why multiple origins?**
   - **Gameplay**: Different weapons or effects might align differently, so multiple sockets let you quickly switch which alignment point is active.
   - **Animation**: For example, a sword might need a slightly different attach point when sheathed vs. when held.
   - **LOD or asset variants**: Origin A might match the high-poly mesh, Origin B for low-poly, etc.

### Example

Imagine a sci-fi gun mesh with 3 origin sockets:

| Socket Name | Purpose                     | Position (local)                                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| origin_a    | First-person hand alignment | `(0,0,0)` offset for player view                        |
| origin_b    | Third-person hand alignment | Slightly different offset to look right in third-person |
| origin_c    | World placement pivot       | Used when the gun is lying on the ground                |

The game’s code would **attach** the gun to a character’s hand bone **at the transform of one of these origin sockets**, depending on context.

If you want, I can **diagram how origin sockets A, B, and C work in a 3D coordinate system**, showing attachment differences for the same model. That might make it much clearer visually.
