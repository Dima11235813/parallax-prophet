# Prompt

We are going start the design of project management for this @initial-prompt.md @prd.md 

Using the proposed template structure shown in 
@prj-mgmt/ 

We must ensure high quality documentation of the requirements so it makes sense to work in steps, please ask questions or make suggestions so we can agree on next steps.

The templates should be copied to create specific organization of epics/features/stories/tasks, so then we can start a sprint.
