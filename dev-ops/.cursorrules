# Cursor Rules

These conventions keep work organized and make it easy to trace commits to tasks.

## Task GUID

- Every task file in `prj-mgmt/` must have a `GUID` (UUID v4).
- Reuse this GUID in branch names, commit footers, and PRs.

## Branch Naming

- Use the task GUID in feature branches:
  - `feature/<area-or-scope>/<short-slug>-<GUID>`
  - Example: `feature/camera/reticle-ready-6f2a5d9b-9c24-4d67-8b7e-2a5fcd1ab4e3`

## Commit Messages

- Conventional commits style.
- Add a footer with the task GUID:
  - `task: <GUID>`

## PR Description

- Include `task: <GUID>` and a link to the task file in `prj-mgmt/`.

## Task File Renaming on Done

- When a task status becomes `Done`, rename the task file to include a `done-` prefix and the GUID, keeping the original slug:
  - From: `tasks/<slug>.md`
  - To: `tasks/done-<slug>-<GUID>.md`
  - Example:
    - From: `tasks/add-baseline-packages.md`
    - To: `tasks/done-add-baseline-packages-6f2a5d9b-9c24-4d67-8b7e-2a5fcd1ab4e3.md`
