# Parallax Prophet Style Guide (Concise)

- Naming: descriptive, full words; functions are verbs; variables are nouns. Avoid 1-2 character names.
- Types: strict TypeScript; annotate function signatures and public APIs; avoid `any`.
- Control Flow: prefer guard clauses and early returns; avoid deep nesting.
- Comments: only for non-obvious logic; explain why, not how.
- Formatting: follow Prettier; keep lines readable; match existing style.
- Git: conventional commits; reference task `GUID` in commit footer as `task: <GUID>`.
- Branches: see `dev-ops/branching-strategy.md`.
