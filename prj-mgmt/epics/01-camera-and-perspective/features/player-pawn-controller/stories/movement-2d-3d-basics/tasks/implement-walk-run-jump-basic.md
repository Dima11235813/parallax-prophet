## Description

- Implement 2D horizontal movement + jump on constrained plane.
- Implement 3D ground-aligned movement with acceleration/deceleration.

## Checklist

- [ ] 2D move/jump implemented and constrained
- [ ] 3D move implemented with accel/decel
- [ ] Basic collision and gravity applied

## Git Linking

- Branch naming: `feature/player/move-basics-<GUID>`
- Commit footer: `task: <GUID>`

## Lifecycle

- Rename file to `done-implement-walk-run-jump-basic-<GUID>.md` when complete.

## Links

- N/A

## Notes

- Tune speeds for readability; avoid camera desync.

## Success Criteria

- QA confirms predictable motion and collision behavior in both modes.
