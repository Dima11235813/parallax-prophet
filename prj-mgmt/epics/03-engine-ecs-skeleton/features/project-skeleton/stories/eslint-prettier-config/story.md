# ESLint + Prettier config

Role: Engineer

## User Story
As an Engineer, I want ESLint and Prettier configured, so that code quality and formatting are enforced consistently.

## Context / Notes
- Include recommended TypeScript rules.

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style)
- Given the project is set up, when I run `npm run lint` and `npm run format`, then linting and formatting complete with no errors on a clean repo.
- Given commit hooks are optional, when enabled, then staged files are linted/formatted.

## Estimation
T-Shirt or points: TBD

## Dependencies
- Vite + TS project scaffold.

## Design / Tech References
- PRD Tooling.

## QA Notes
- Verify Windows path compatibility.
