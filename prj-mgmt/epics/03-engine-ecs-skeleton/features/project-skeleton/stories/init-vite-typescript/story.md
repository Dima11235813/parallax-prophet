# Init Vite + TypeScript

Role: Engineer

## User Story

As an Engineer, I want a Vite + strict TypeScript project scaffold, so that I can develop and run the game locally quickly.

## Context / Notes

- Include scripts for dev/build/test.

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style)

- Given the repository is cloned, when I run `npm install && npm run dev`, then the app serves at localhost:5173.
- Given strict mode is required, when the project compiles, then TypeScript `strict` is enabled with no errors.
