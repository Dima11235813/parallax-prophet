# Input & HUD Basics

Owner: TBD
Status: Planned

## Overview
- Implement input mapping/remapping and HUD to show alignment readiness and prompts.

## Business Value

## Non-Goals
- Full menu systems.

## Dependencies
- Signals from camera/alignment systems.

## Risks & Assumptions
- Risk: unclear feedback; assume simple icon + color states suffice.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Players can remap controls; HUD reflects alignment readiness states.
