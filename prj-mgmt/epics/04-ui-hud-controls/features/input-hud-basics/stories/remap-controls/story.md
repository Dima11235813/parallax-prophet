# Remap controls

Role: Player

## User Story
As a Player, I want to remap controls, so that I can play comfortably.

## Context / Notes
- Minimal UI for binding changes.

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style)
- Given I open the controls UI, when I select an action and press a new key, then the binding updates and persists.
- Given a conflict occurs, when a key is already bound, then the UI prompts to replace or cancel.

## Estimation
T-Shirt or points: TBD

## Dependencies
- Input system.

## Design / Tech References
- PRD Accessibility.

## QA Notes
- Test keyboard and gamepad if available.
