## Overview
- Input mapping/remapping and minimal HUD elements to surface state (alignment readiness, prompts).

## Success Metrics (TBD allowed)
- Players can remap keys; HUD displays alignment readiness correctly in test scene.

## Scope
- Input system, remapping UI, alignment HUD indicator.

## Out of Scope
- Full menus/inventory; art polish.

## Dependencies
- Engine skeleton; signals from camera/perspective system.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: UX confusion; Mitigation: clear iconography and color-safe palette.

## Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)
- Controls remappable; HUD shows alignment readiness states.
