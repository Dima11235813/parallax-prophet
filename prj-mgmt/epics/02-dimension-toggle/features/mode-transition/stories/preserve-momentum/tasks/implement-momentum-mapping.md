Assignee: TBD
Related Story: ../story.md
Estimate: TBD
Priority: P1

## Description
- Map velocity/orientation between 2D and 3D modes with easing.

## Checklist
- [ ] Define mapping rules 3D→2D and 2D→3D
- [ ] Apply on toggle with blending
- [ ] Add debug overlay for values

## Links
- Designs/specs: TBD

## Notes
- Avoid spikes; clamp as needed.

## Success Criteria
- Momentum feels continuous in tests; no unintended acceleration.
