# Playwright setup

Role: Engineer

As an Engineer, I want Playwright configured, so that I can run end-to-end browser tests.

## Context / Notes
- Use Chromium initially; CI-friendly scripts.

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style)
- Given the repo, when I run `npm run test:e2e`, then Playwright runs a sample test successfully in headless mode.

## Estimation
TBD

## Dependencies
- Project scaffold.

## Design / Tech References
- Playwright docs.

## QA Notes
- Ensure `npx playwright install` handled via script.
