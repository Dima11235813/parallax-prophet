# Create Vite TS app

Role: Engineer

## User Story
As an Engineer, I want a Vite + TypeScript app scaffold, so that I can run and iterate quickly.

## Context / Notes
- Use Vite TS template; modern ESM.

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style)
- Given a fresh clone, when I run `npm create vite@latest` and set up TS, then `npm run dev` serves the app at localhost:5173.
- Given TS strict is required, when I open tsconfig, then `"strict": true` is set and compile is clean.

## Estimation
TBD

## Dependencies
- Node toolchain.

## Design / Tech References
- Vite docs.

## QA Notes
- Verify Windows dev flow.
