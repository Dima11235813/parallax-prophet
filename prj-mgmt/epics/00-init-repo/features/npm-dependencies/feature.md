# NPM Dependencies & Scripts

Owner: TBD
Status: Planned

## Overview

- Define baseline dependencies and npm scripts for dev, build, test, lint, and format.

## Business Value

- Standardizes local workflows and enables CI setup later.

## Non-Goals

- Locking specific versions beyond caret unless required.

## Dependencies

- Project scaffold.

## Risks & Assumptions

- Avoid unnecessary bloat; keep minimal.

## Acceptance Criteria

- package.json contains agreed baseline deps and scripts; fresh install succeeds.
