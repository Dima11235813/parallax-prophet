# Add scripts

Role: Engineer

## User Story
As an Engineer, I want standard npm scripts, so that common tasks are discoverable and easy to run.

## Context / Notes
- dev, build, preview, test, test:watch, test:e2e, lint, format, format:check.

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style)
- Given package.json, when I run the scripts, then each command executes successfully on a fresh clone with installed deps.

## Estimation
TBD

## Dependencies
- Packages installed.

## Design / Tech References
- Tool docs.

## QA Notes
- Cross-platform command compatibility.
